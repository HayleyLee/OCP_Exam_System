        This chapter contains 85 questions and is designed to simulate a
real OCP exam. While previous chapters were focused on a specific
set of objectives, this chapter covers all of the objectives on the
exam. We recommend you take this exam only after you score well
on the questions in the individual chapters.
For this chapter, you should try to simulate the real exam experience as much as possible. This means setting aside 150 minutes of
uninterrupted time to complete the test, as well as not looking at
any reference material while taking the exam. If you donâ€™t know an
answer to a question, complete it as best you can and move on to
the next question, just as you would on a real exam.
Remember, the exam permits writing material, such as a
whiteboard. If you do not have a whiteboard handy, you can just
use blank sheets of paper and a pencil. If you do well on this test,
then you are hopefully ready to take the real exam. With that said,
good luck!
